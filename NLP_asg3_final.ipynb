He has been to multiple institutions as an outpatient for this complaint.  He has had what appears to be prepatellar bursa aspirated with little to no success.  He has been treated with Kefzol and 1 g of Rocephin one point.  He also reports, in the emergency department today, an attempt was made to aspirate his actual knee joint which was unsuccessful.  Orthopedic Surgery was consulted at this time.  Considering the patient's physical exam, there is a portal that would prove to be outside of the erythema that would be useful for aspiration of the knee.  After discussion of risks and benefits, the patient elected to proceed with aspiration through the anterolateral portal of his knee joint.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient's right anterolateral knee area was prepped with Betadine times two and a 20-gauge spinal needle was used to approach the knee joint approximately 3 cm anterior and 2 cm lateral to the superolateral pole of the patella.  The 20-gauge spinal needle was inserted and entered the knee joint.  Approximately, 4 cc of clear yellow fluid was aspirated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,DISPOSITION: , Based upon the appearance of this synovial fluid, we have a very low clinical suspicion of a septic joint.  We will send this fluid to the lab for cell count, crystal exam, as well as culture and Gram stain.  We will follow these results.  After discussion with the emergency department staff, it appears that they tend to try to treat his erythema which appears to be cellulitis with IV antibiotics.\",\n          \"REASON FOR CONSULT:,  Depression.,HPI:,  The patient is an 87-year-old white female admitted for low back pain status post hip fracture sustained a few days before Thanksgiving in 2006.

The patient has a history of chronic osteomyelitis and non-healing ulceration to the left hallux of almost 10 years' duration.  He has failed outpatient antibiotic therapy and conservative methods.  At this time, he desires to attempt surgical correction.  The patient is not interested in a hallux amputation at this time; however, he is consenting to removal of infected bone.  He was counseled preoperatively about the strong probability of the hallux being a \\\"floppy tail\\\" after the surgery and accepts the fact.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient's wound was debrided with a #15 blade and down to good healthy tissue preoperatively.  The wound was on the planar medial, distal and dorsal medial.  The wound's bases were fibrous.  They did not break the bone at this point.  They were each approximately 0.5 cm in diameter.  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with safety straps placed across his waist for his protection.,Due to the patient's history of diabetes and marked calcifications on x-ray, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was not applied.  Next, a total of 3 cc of a 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine plain was used to infiltrate the left hallux and perform a digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  It was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the left hallux after the sterile stockinet was reflected.  Next, a #10 blade was used to make a linear incision approximately 3.5 cm in length along the dorsal aspect of the hallux from the base to just proximal to the eponychium.  Next, the incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissue.  A heavy amount of bleeding was encountered.  Therefore, a Penrose drain was applied at the tourniquet, which failed.  Next, an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the distal toes and forefoot and was left in the forefoot to achieve hemostasis.  Any small veins crossing throughout the subcutaneous layer were ligated via electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral margins of the incision were under marked with a sharp dissection down to the level of the long extension tendon.  The long extensor tendon was thickened and overall exhibited signs of hypertrophy.  The transverse incision through the long extensor tendon was made with a #15 blade.  Immediately upon entering the joint, yellow discolored fluid was drained from the interphalangeal joint.  Next, the extensor tendon was peeled dorsally and distally off the bone.  Immediately the head of the proximal phalanx was found to be lytic, disease, friable, crumbly, and there were free fragments of the medial aspect of the bone, the head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was removed with a sharp dissection.  Next, after adequate exposure was obtained and the collateral ligaments were released off the head of proximal phalanx, a sagittal saw was used to resect the approximately one-half of the proximal phalanx.  This was passed off as the infected bone specimen for microbiology and pathology.  Next, the base of the distal phalanx was exposed with sharp dissection and a rongeur was used to remove soft crumbly diseased medial and plantar aspect at the base of distal phalanx.  Next, there was diseased soft tissue envelope around the bone, which was also resected to good healthy tissue margins.  The pulse lavage was used to flush the wound with 1000 cc of gentamicin-impregnated saline.  Next, cleaned instruments were used to take a proximal section of proximal phalanx to label a clean margin.  This bone was found to be hard and healthy appearing.  The wound after irrigation was free of all debris and infected tissue.  Therefore anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and sent to microbiology.  Next, OsteoSet beads, tobramycin-impregnated, were placed.  Six beads were placed in the wound.  Next, the extensor tendon was re-approximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress technique.,The Esmarch bandage was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted at the digits.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of 4 x 4s, Betadine-soaked #0-1 silk, Kerlix, Kling, and a loosely applied Ace wrap.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  He was transported via a cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  His vitals signs were stable and vascular status was intact.  He was given a medium postop shoe that was well-formed and fitting.  He is to elevate his foot, but not apply ice.  He is to follow up with Dr. X.  He was given emergency contact numbers.  He is to continue the Vicodin p.r.n. pain that he was taking previously for his shoulder pain and has enough of the medicine at home.  The patient was discharged in stable condition.\",\n          \"PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS:,  Chest pain secondary to fractured ribs, unmanageable with narcotics.,POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS:,  Chest pain secondary to fractured ribs, unmanageable with narcotics.,PROCEDURE: , Intercostal block from fourth to tenth intercostal spaces, left.,INDICATIONS: , I was requested by Dr. X to do an intercostal block on this lady who fell and has fractured ribs, whose chest pain is paralyzing and not responding well to increasing doses of narcotics.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:,  After obtaining an informed consent with the patient on her bedside, she was placed in the right decubitus position with the left side up.  The posterior left chest wall was prepped and draped in the usual fashion and then a mixture of 1% Xylocaine 20 mL and Marcaine 0.25% 20 mL were mixed together and the intercostal spaces from the fourth to the tenth ribs were anesthetized.  A total of 30 mL worth of solution was used.  I also injected some local anesthetic subcutaneously into an area of contusion in the left lumbar area.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She had no respiratory distress.  Immediately, the patient felt some relief from the pain.  Chest x-ray was ordered for the following day.\",\n          \"CHIEF COMPLAINT: , MGUS.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is an extremely pleasant 86-year-old gentleman, who I follow for his MGUS.  I initially saw him for thrombocytopenia when his ANC was 1300.  A bone marrow biopsy was obtained.  Interestingly enough, at the time of his bone marrow biopsy, his hemoglobin was 13.0 and his white blood cell count was 6.5 with a platelet count of 484,000.  His bone marrow biopsy showed a normal cellular bone marrow; however, there were 10% plasma cells and we proceeded with the workup for a plasma cell dyscrasia.  All his tests came back as consistent with an MGUS.,Overall, he is doing well.  Since I last saw him, he tells me that he has had onset of atrial fibrillation.  He has now started going to the gym two times per week, and has lost over 10 pounds.  He has a good energy level and his ECOG performance status is 0.  He denies any fever, chills, or night sweats.  No lymphadenopathy.  No nausea or vomiting.  No change in bowel or bladder habits.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Multivitamin q.d., aspirin one tablet q.d., Lupron q. three months, Flomax  0.4 mg q.d., and Warfarin 2.5 mg q.d.,ALLERGIES:  ,No known drug allergies.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , As per the HPI, otherwise negative.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.

The posterior left chest wall was prepped and draped in the usual fashion and then a mixture of 1% Xylocaine 20 mL and Marcaine 0.25% 20 mL were mixed together and the intercostal spaces from the fourth to the tenth ribs were anesthetized.  A total of 30 mL worth of solution was used.  I also injected some local anesthetic subcutaneously into an area of contusion in the left lumbar area.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.

A time-out process had been followed and then the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the endotracheal tube after 2 cc of 4% lidocaine had been infused into the endotracheal tube.  First the trachea and the carina had normal appearance.  The scope was passed into the left side and the bronchial system was found to be normal.  There were scars and mucoid secretions.  Then the scope was passed into the right side where brown secretions were obtained and collected in a trap to be sent for culture and sensitivity of aerobic and anaerobic fungi and TB.  First, the basal lobes were explored and found to be normal.  Then, the right upper lobe was selectively cannulated and no abnormalities were found except some secretions were aspirated.  Then, the bronchi going to the three segments were visualized and no abnormalities or mass were found.  Brush biopsy was obtained from one of the segments and sent to Pathology.,The procedure had to be interrupted several times because of the patient's desaturation, but after a few minutes of Ambu bagging, he recovered satisfactorily.,At the end, the patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.,\",\n          \"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 65-year-old female who underwent left upper lobectomy for stage IA non-small cell lung cancer.  She returns for a routine surveillance visit.,She has undergone since her last visit an abdominopelvic CT, which shows an enlarging simple cyst of the left kidney.  She underwent barium swallow, which demonstrates a small sliding hiatal hernia with minimal reflux.  She has a minimal delayed emptying secondary tertiary contractions.  PA and lateral chest x-ray from the 11/23/09 was also reviewed, which demonstrates no lesions or infiltrates.  Review of systems, the patient continues to have periodic odynophagia and mid thoracic dysphagia.  This most likely is secondary to tertiary contractions with some delayed emptying.  She has also had increased size of the left calf without tenderness, which has not resolved over the past several months.  She has had a previous DVT in 1975 and 1985.  She denies weight loss, anorexia, fevers, chills, headaches, new aches or pains, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath at rest, or dyspnea on exertion.,MEDICATIONS: , Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Spiriva 10 mcg q.d., and albuterol p.r.n.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , BP:  117/78.

Cranial nerves II through XII intact.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient has no evidence of disease now status post left upper lobectomy for stage IA non-small cell lung cancer 13 months ago.,PLAN:  ,She is to return to clinic in six months with a chest CT.  She was given a prescription for an ultrasound of the left lower extremity to rule out DVT.  She will be called with the results.
